## 03 PASSWORD GENERATOR USING JAVASCRIPT

This homework assignment emphasizes the use of Javascript that enables the employees (the users) to generate random 
passwords based on the criteria they selected. The HTML, CSS, and a starter code for Javascript are provided. The task is to modify the code in Javascript and making dynamic changes to the HMTL document. 


## DEPLOYMENT

The respository name is "PASSWORD-GENERATOR" as this is a random password generator to generate passwords.

The application is deployed at : https://stellalph.github.io/PASSWORD-GENERATOR/ and the GitHub repository that contains the application code is https://github.com/stellalph/PASSWORD-GENERATOR.git


## PASSWORD GENERATOR CRITERIA

I have provided an image in which you find in this repository, that is, "Password written to page.jpg" of the password written to the page after going through a series of prompts messages in which the user is required to enter at (window.prompt).

The steps taken to achieve the final result as on the screen:-

    - Clicking on the "Generate Password" will trigger a series of prompt messages to the user to enter and confirm.
      (The code is written using Javascript Functions, Window Methods, String Methods and Selection Methods).

    - The user will be prompted to enter the password criteria :-
        *  password length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
        *  the character types they want to include, that is, lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special
          characters.

    - The application should then validate the user input and ensure that at least one character should be 
      selected.

    - When the user have answered all the prompt messages, the user will be presented with the password which will 
      match with the selected criteria.

    - This password is written to the page as per the link.  This is also located in the repository.

    - Event listener will determine the password output with function to populate the value into the "Your Secure 
      Pasword" area.
